This Firefox add-on arranges tabs in a vertical rather than horizontal
fashion. Vertical Tabs Reloaded is a fork of [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/), which was discontinued. The original project is heavily inspired by the Tree Style Tab add-on.

## Firefox ESR v52 users
Install the version v0.8.2 from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs-reloaded/versions/?page=1#version-0.8.2


## Features

 * arranges tabs vertical
 * ships 5 different styles for the tab sidebar
 * hide/display manually the tab sidebar at any time with a hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+V)
 * display the tab toolbar at top, bottom (default) or hide it completely
 * compact mode: hide text labels on tabs for a minimalistic tab sidebar (opt-in)
 * show the tab status (unloaded, unready, busy) visually on the tabs


## Goals

 * Minimalist implementation.

 * Native look and feel and ability to customize if wanted.

 * Readable, maintainable and robust code.


## Platform Support

Only the latest Firefox version is fully supported. Compatibility with the latest [ESR version](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/) will not get broken on purpose, but it might be necessary to do so sometimes. Pull requests fixing compatibility with the latest ESR version have a good chance to get accepted. Pull requests concerning other versions as the latest Firefox version or the latest Firefox ESR version will not be accepted.


## Building
You need Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then install web-ext:
> npm install -g web-ext

After that you can build the add-on by executing in the project's root directory:
> web-ext build
